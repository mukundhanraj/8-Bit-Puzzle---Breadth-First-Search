To run the main file: cd proj1_Mukundhan_Rajendiran/python3 algo.py

All the required functions are in a separate file called fn.py.

The start node is [[4, 7, 0], [1, 2, 8], [3, 5, 6]] and
    Goal node is [[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 0]] in row wise format.

To change the starting and ending node: open the algo.py and change st_node & gl_node

Once algo.py is run, 3 files are generated nodePath.txt , nodes.txt , Nodesinfo.txt

The explored paths can be represented using the plot_path.py file. It uses the above 3 generated files to create the figures.
